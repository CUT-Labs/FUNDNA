#### Descrption
When we hear about computation and information processing the first thing that comes to our minds is man-made electronic processing systems. However, computation is not a man-made phenomenon and, in fact, the most powerful information processing systems have been provided by nature. For example, complex circuits within cells

- can have over 30,000 distinct states;

- their computational efficiency per operation is 4 to 5 orders of magnitude more efficient than nano-scale GHz electronic processors regarding energy and size;

- they are massively parallel such that more than 10,000,000 biochemical reactions fire in a human cell each second.

Our research is about the exploration of computational power in bio-molecular systems. Since the chemical reaction network (CRN) theory is the fundamental model in the study of molecular reactions, we try to understand and discover the information processing abilities of CRNs and accordingly design new molecular systems for particular applications. One part of this research is the design of digital signal processing algorithms by CRNs. Another part is the computation of mathematical functions by CRNs using a new encoding of information so called fractional representation. In order to address practical issues for biological implementation of these designs, we map the CRNs to DNA reactions using DNA strand-displacement mechanism. Applications for our research are drug delivery and monitoring, smart and personalized drugs.

Further, we work on encoding and storing information by DNA molecules as they have the potential to be used as future memories with longer retention, higher density  and lower power consumption compared to semiconductor memories. Also we are interested in the interface of biological circuits (e.g., DNA and RNA molecules) with semiconductor circuits and sensors.

## The Software
In this GitHub Repository, there are several python files that are able to be executed to assist in generating Chemical Reaction Networks for a given function. Though functions are limited at the program's current state, it is a very useful tool for cross-checking any calculations.
